\chapter{Testing on Websites}

We will test the CookieAudit extension on a diverse set of relevant websites. 

\section{Composition of Websites}

\subsection{Factors}

There are many factors that can influence the cookie compliance of websites.
Our set of websites will need to contain representative websites across those factors.

\subsubsection{Countries}

To cover potential geographical differences in compliance we will include websites from different countries in the European Union.

\subsubsection{Consent Management Platforms and Custom Notices}

Website developers can implement cookie consent functionality either themselves or by using Consent Management Platforms, which are developed by different providers.
Therefore, our testing set will contain websites from both groups.
