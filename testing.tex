\section{Creating a Set of Websites}

We will create two distinct sets of websites to test and evaluate the CookieAudit browser extension. 
The websites will be a random sample from the dataset of Bouhoula et al.~\cite{bouhoula2023automated}. 

The first set will contain 50 websites from 5 countries (France, Germany, Poland, Ireland and the USA).
We will only consider the 1000 most popular websites in those countries by relying on the Chrome User Experience report~\cite{GoogleCrux}. 

The second set will contain 20 websites each using one of the 20 most common Consent Management Providers. CookieAudit has to work with common CMPs to be a practical tool.

After manually running the CookieAudit browser extension on the websites, we will compare the results with the findings of Bouhoula et al.~\cite{bouhoula2023automated}.
