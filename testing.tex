\section{Creating a Set of Websites}

We will create two distinct sets of websites to test and evaluate the CookieAudit browser extension. 
The websites will be a random sample based on the dataset of Bouhoula et al.~\cite{bouhoula2023automated}. 
The first set will contain 50 websites from 5 countries (France, Germany, Poland, Ireland and the USA).
We will sample websites of different popularities from the Chrome User Experience report~\cite{GoogleCrux}.
Specifically, we will cover web pages from the CrUX ranks\footnote{For example the CrUX rank 1k contains the 1000 most popular web pages of a given country} 1k, 5k, 10k, 100k and 500k.
CookieAudit has to work with common Consent Management Providers to be a practical tool.
The second set will therefore contain 20 websites with each using one of the 20 most common CMPs. 
After manually running the CookieAudit browser extension on the websites, we will compare the results with the corresponding findings of Bouhoula et al.~\cite{bouhoula2023automated}.
